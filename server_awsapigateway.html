		<h1>CORS on AWS API Gateway</h1>
		<p>
			<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home">Amazon API Gateway</a> adds support for CORS enabling through a simple button in the API Gateway console. Unfortunately that button has a partial behavior, thus setting CORS correctly only for 200 answer (so not other HTTP status codes) and ignoring JQuery
			header support. The best solution considered so far is about avoding to use the CORS button and set configurations manually. This can be achieved in a couple of steps:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Log into API Gateway console</li>
			<li>Create all the REST resources that needs to be exposed with their methods before setting up CORS (if new resources/methods are created after enabling CORS, these steps must be repeated)</li>
			<li>Select a resource</li>
			<li>Add OPTIONS method, choose as integration type "mock"</li>
			<li>For each Method of a resource</li>
			<li>Go to Response Method</li>
			<li>Add all the response method that should be supported (i.e. 200, 500, etc.)</li>
			<li>For each response code set Response Headers to
				<ul>
					<li>X-Requested-With </li>
					<li>Access-Control-Allow-Headers </li>
					<li>Access-Control-Allow-Origin </li>
					<li>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>Go to Integration Response, select one of the created response codes, then Header Mappings</li>
				<li>Insert default falues for headers
					<br/> example:

				<ul>
					<li>X-Requested-With: '*' </li>
					<li>Access-Control-Allow-Headers: 'Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,x-requested-with' </li>
					<li>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*' </li>
					<li>Access-Control-Allow-Methods: 'POST,GET,OPTIONS' </li>
				</ul>
				This operation has to be repeated for each method, including the newly created OPTIONS</li>
				<li>Deploy the API to a stage</li>
				<li>Check using http://client.cors-api.appspot.com/client that CORS requests have been successfully enabled</li>
		</ol>
